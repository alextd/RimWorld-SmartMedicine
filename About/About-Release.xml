	<description>Doctors will use medicine from their inventory. What a concept!
		
Doctors can also use medicine from the patient's inventory, or anyone else on the map, even pack animals brought on a caravan.

They can also keep their inventory stocked with medicine. The Gear Tab has Settings for each Colonist.

An option to use cheaper medicine, if it will do just as well ( due to doctor skill, bionics, medical bed, etc. ) Note this doesn't affect surgery.

An option to use minimal medicine for non-urgent wounds, or none at all.

An option to tend patients in the field - if there are no beds available, or just always.

Multiple doctors can reserve the same stack of medicine. The game actually supports multiple reservations, but the feature was just not used.

Now technically, inventory medicine is dropped and immediately picked back up - but what can you do.
